This document provides a comprehensive guide to launching and managing the 
Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) training task within the RLinf framework, 
focusing on finetuning a VLA model for robotic manipulation in the LIBERO environment. 

The primary objective is to develop a model capable of performing robotic manipulation by:

1. **Visual Understanding**: Processing RGB images from the robot's camera.
2. **Language Comprehension**: Interpreting natural-language task descriptions.
3. **Action Generation**: Producing precise robotic actions (position, rotation, gripper control).
4. **Reinforcement Learning**: Optimizing the policy via the PPO with environment feedback.

Environment
-----------------------

**LIBERO Environment**

- **Environment**: LIBERO simulation benchmark built on top of *robosuite* (MuJoCo).
- **Task**: Command a 7-DoF robotic arm to perform a variety of household manipulation skills (pick-and-place, stacking, opening drawers, spatial rearrangement).
- **Observation**: RGB images (typical resolutions 128 × 128 or 224 × 224) captured by off-screen cameras placed around the workspace.
- **Action Space**: 7-dimensional continuous actions  
  - 3D end-effector position control (x, y, z)  
  - 3D rotation control (roll, pitch, yaw)  
  - Gripper control (open / close)

**Task Description Format**

.. code-block:: text

   In: What action should the robot take to [task_description]?
   Out: 

**Data Structure**

- **Images**: RGB tensors ``[batch_size, 224, 224, 3]``
- **Task Descriptions**: Natural-language instructions
- **Actions**: Normalized continuous values converted to discrete tokens
- **Rewards**: Step-level rewards based on task completion

Algorithm
-----------------------------------------

**Core Algorithm Components**

1. **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**

   - Advantage estimation using GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation)

   - Policy clipping with ratio limits

   - Value function clipping

   - Entropy regularization

2. **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**

   - For every state / prompt the policy generates *G* independent actions

   - Compute the advantage of each action by subtracting the group’s mean reward.


3. **Vision-Language-Action Model**

   - OpenVLA architecture with multimodal fusion

   - Action tokenization and de-tokenization

   - Value head for critic function

   source switch_env openvla-oft

**Option 2: Custom Environment**

Install dependencies directly in your environment by running the following command:

.. code:: bash

   # For mainland China users, you can add the `--use-mirror` flag to the install.sh command for better download speed.

   bash requirements/install.sh embodied --model openvla-oft --env maniskill_libero
   source .venv/bin/activate

Model Download
--------------

Before starting training, you need to download the corresponding pretrained model:

.. code:: bash

   # Download the model (choose either method)
   # Method 1: Using git clone
   git lfs install
   git clone https://huggingface.co/RLinf/RLinf-OpenVLAOFT-LIBERO-90-Base-Lora
   git clone https://huggingface.co/RLinf/RLinf-OpenVLAOFT-LIBERO-130-Base-Lora

   # Method 2: Using huggingface-hub
   # For mainland China users, you can use the following for better download speed:
   # export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
   pip install huggingface-hub
   hf download RLinf/RLinf-OpenVLAOFT-LIBERO-90-Base-Lora --local-dir RLinf-OpenVLAOFT-LIBERO-90-Base-Lora
   hf download RLinf/RLinf-OpenVLAOFT-LIBERO-130-Base-Lora --local-dir RLinf-OpenVLAOFT-LIBERO-130-Base-Lora

After downloading, make sure to correctly specify the model path in the configuration yaml file.

.. code:: yaml

   rollout:
      model:
         model_path: Pathto/RLinf/RLinf-OpenVLAOFT-LIBERO-90-Base-Lora
   actor:
      model:
         model_path: Pathto/RLinf/RLinf-OpenVLAOFT-LIBERO-90-Base-Lora

Running the Script
-------------------

**1. Key Parameters Configuration**

.. code-block:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 2
      component_placement:
         env: 0-7
         rollout: 8-15
         actor: 0-15

   rollout:
      pipeline_stage_num: 2

Here you can flexibly configure the GPU count for env, rollout, and actor components.
Additionally, by setting `pipeline_stage_num = 2` in the configuration, you can achieve pipeline overlap between rollout and env, improving rollout efficiency.

.. code-block:: yaml
   
   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env,rollout,actor: all

You can also reconfigure the placement to achieve complete sharing, where env, rollout, and actor components all share all GPUs.

.. code-block:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 2
      component_placement:
         env: 0-3
         rollout: 4-7
         actor: 8-15

You can also reconfigure the placement to achieve complete separation, where env, rollout, and actor components each use their own GPUs without interference, eliminating the need for offload functionality.

**2. Configuration Files**

We currently support training in two environments: **ManiSkill3** and **LIBERO**.

We support the **OpenVLA-OFT** model with both **PPO** and **GRPO** algorithms.  
The corresponding configuration files are:

- **OpenVLA-OFT + PPO**: ``examples/embodiment/config/libero_10_ppo_openvlaoft.yaml``
- **OpenVLA-OFT + GRPO**: ``examples/embodiment/config/libero_10_grpo_openvlaoft.yaml``

**3. Launch Commands**

To start training with a chosen configuration, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash examples/embodiment/run_embodiment.sh CHOSEN_CONFIG

For example, to train the OpenVLA-OFT model using the GRPO algorithm in the LIBERO environment, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash examples/embodiment/run_embodiment.sh libero_10_grpo_openvlaoft


Visualization and Results
-------------------------

**1. TensorBoard Logging**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Start TensorBoard
   tensorboard --logdir ./logs --port 6006

**2. Key Metrics Tracked**

- **Training Metrics**:

  - ``train/actor/approx_kl``: Approximate KL divergence between old and new policies.
  - ``train/actor/clip_fraction``: Fraction of updates where the probability ratio was clipped.
  - ``train/actor/clipped_ratio``: Mean of the clipped probability ratios.
  - ``train/actor/grad_norm``: Gradient norm.
  - ``train/actor/lr``: Learning rate.
  - ``train/actor/policy_loss``: PPO/GRPO policy loss.
  - ``train/critic/value_loss``: Value function loss.
  - ``train/critic/value_clip_ratio``: Fraction of value targets whose update was clipped.
  - ``train/critic/explained_variance``: Explained variance of the value function predictions.
  - ``train/entropy_loss``: Policy entropy.
  - ``train/loss``: Total training loss (actor_loss + critic_loss + entropy_loss regularization).

- **Rollout Metrics**:

  - ``rollout/advantages_max``: the max of the advantage.
  - ``rollout/advantages_mean``: the mean of the advantage.
  - ``rollout/advantages_min``: the min of the advantage.
  - ``rollout/rewards``: chunk of reward (refer to L414 in libero_env.py).

- **Environment Metrics**:

  - ``env/episode_len``: Number of environment steps elapsed in the episode (unit: step).
  - ``env/return``: Episode return. In LIBERO’s sparse-reward setting this metric is not informative, since the reward is almost always 0 until the terminal success step.
  - ``env/reward``: Step-level reward (0 for all intermediate steps and 1 only at successful termination).  
    The logged value is normalized by the number of episode steps, which makes it difficult to interpret as real task performance during training.
  - ``env/success_once``: Recommended metric to monitor training performance. It directly reflects the unnormalized episodic success rate.

**3. Video Generation**

.. code-block:: yaml

   env:
      eval:
         video_cfg:
            save_video: True
            video_base_dir: ${runner.logger.log_path}/video/eval

**4. Train Log Tool Integration**

.. code-block:: yaml

   runner:
      task_type: embodied
      logger:
         log_path: "../results"
         project_name: rlinf
         experiment_name: "libero_10_grpo_openvlaoft"
         logger_backends: ["tensorboard"] # wandb, swanlab


LIBERO Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to show the RLinf’s capability for large-scale multi-task RL. We train a single unified model on all 130 tasks in LIBERO and evaluate its performance across the five LIBERO task suites: LIBERO-Spatial, LIBERO-Goal, LIBERO-Object, LIBERO-Long, and LIBERO-90. 

For each LIBERO suite, we evaluate every combination of task_id and trial_id. 
For the Object, Spatial, Goal, and Long suites, we evaluate 500 environments in total (10 tasks × 50 trials). 
For LIBERO-90 and LIBERO-130, we evaluate 4,500 (90 tasks × 50 trials) and 6,500 environments respectively (130 tasks × 50 trials).

We evaluate each model according to its training configuration.
For the SFT-trained (LoRA-base) models, we set `do_sample = False`.
For the RL-trained models, we set `do_sample = True`, `temperature = 1.6`, and enable `rollout_epoch=2` to elicit the best performance of the RL-tuned policy.

.. note:: 
   
   This unified base model is fine-tuned by ourselves. For more details, please refer to paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06710.
