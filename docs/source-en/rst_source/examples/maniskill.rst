This document provides a comprehensive guide to launching and managing the 
Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) training task within the RLinf framework, 
focusing on finetuning a VLA model for robotic manipulation in the ManiSkill3 environment. 

The primary objective is to develop a model capable of performing robotic manipulation by:

1. **Visual Understanding**: Processing RGB images from the robot's camera.
2. **Language Comprehension**: Interpreting natural-language task descriptions.
3. **Action Generation**: Producing precise robotic actions (position, rotation, gripper control).
4. **Reinforcement Learning**: Optimizing the policy via the PPO with environment feedback.

Environment
-----------

**ManiSkill3 Environment**

- **Environment**: ManiSkill3 simulation platform
- **Task**: Control a robotic arm to grasp a variety of objects
- **Observation**: RGB images (224×224) from a third-person camera
- **Action Space**: 7-dimensional continuous actions
  - 3D position control (x, y, z)
  - 3D rotation control (roll, pitch, yaw)
  - Gripper control (open/close)

**Task Description Format**

.. code-block:: text

   In: What action should the robot take to [task_description]?
   Out: 

**Data Structure**

- **Images**: RGB tensors ``[batch_size, 224, 224, 3]``
- **Task Descriptions**: Natural-language instructions
- **Actions**: Normalized continuous values converted to discrete tokens
- **Rewards**: Step-level rewards based on task completion

Algorithm
-----------------------------------------

**Core Algorithm Components**

1. **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**

   - Advantage estimation using GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation)

   - Policy clipping with ratio limits

   - Value function clipping

   - Entropy regularization

2. **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**

   - For every state / prompt the policy generates *G* independent actions

   - Compute the advantage of each action by subtracting the group’s mean reward.


3. **Vision-Language-Action Model**

   - OpenVLA architecture with multimodal fusion

   - Action tokenization and de-tokenization

   - Value head for critic function

Dependency Installation
-----------------------

1. Clone RLinf Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

   # For mainland China users, you can use the following for better download speed:
   # git clone https://ghfast.top/github.com/RLinf/RLinf.git
   git clone https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf.git
   cd RLinf

2. Install Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Option 1: Docker Image**

Use Docker image for the experiment.

.. code:: bash

   docker run -it --rm --gpus all \
      --shm-size 20g \
      --network host \
      --name rlinf \
      -v .:/workspace/RLinf \
      rlinf/rlinf:agentic-rlinf0.1-torch2.6.0-openvla-openvlaoft-pi0
      # For mainland China users, you can use the following for better download speed:
      # docker.1ms.run/rlinf/rlinf:agentic-rlinf0.1-torch2.6.0-openvla-openvlaoft-pi0

For experiments on different models, please switch to the corresponding virtual environment via the built-in `switch_env` utility in the image:

.. code:: bash

   # Switch to OpenVLA environment
   source switch_env openvla
   # Switch to OpenVLA-OFT environment
   source switch_env openvla-oft

**Option 2: Custom Environment**

Install dependencies directly in your environment by running the following command:

.. code:: bash

   # For mainland China users, you can add the `--use-mirror` flag to the install.sh command for better download speed.

   # Change --model to openvla-oft for OpenVLA-OFT model experiment
   bash requirements/install.sh embodied --model openvla --env maniskill_libero
   source .venv/bin/activate

Assets Download
----------------

Download the ManiSkill assets by running the following command:

.. code:: bash

   cd <path_to_RLinf>/rlinf/envs/maniskill
   # For mainland China users, you can use the following for better download speed:
   # export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
   hf download --repo-type dataset RLinf/maniskill_assets --local-dir ./assets

Model Download
--------------

Before starting training, you need to download the corresponding pretrained model and assets:

.. code:: bash

   # Download the model (choose either method)
   # Method 1: Using git clone
   git lfs install
   git clone https://huggingface.co/gen-robot/openvla-7b-rlvla-warmup

   # Method 2: Using huggingface-hub
   # For mainland China users, you can use the following for better download speed:
   # export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
   pip install huggingface-hub
   hf download gen-robot/openvla-7b-rlvla-warmup --local-dir openvla-7b-rlvla-warmup

After downloading, make sure to correctly specify the model path in the configuration yaml file.

Besides, you also need to add the assets if there is no `assets/` dir in Pathto/rlinf/envs/maniskill . The download instruction can be found here in `huggingface <https://huggingface.co/datasets/RLinf/maniskill_assets>`_.

Running the Script
-------------------

**1. Key Parameters Configuration**

.. code-block:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 2
      component_placement:
         env: 0-7
         rollout: 8-15
         actor: 0-15

   rollout:
      pipeline_stage_num: 2

Here you can flexibly configure the GPU count for env, rollout, and actor components.
Additionally, by setting `pipeline_stage_num = 2` in the configuration, you can achieve pipeline overlap between rollout and env, improving rollout efficiency.

.. code-block:: yaml
   
   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env,rollout,actor: all

You can also reconfigure the placement to achieve complete sharing, where env, rollout, and actor components all share all GPUs.

.. code-block:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 2
      component_placement:
         env: 0-3
         rollout: 4-7
         actor: 8-15

You can also reconfigure the placement to achieve complete separation, where env, rollout, and actor components each use their own GPUs without interference, eliminating the need for offload functionality.

**2. Configuration Files**

We support two models: **OpenVLA** and **OpenVLA-OFT**, along with two algorithms: **PPO** and **GRPO**.  
The corresponding configuration files are:

- **OpenVLA + PPO**: ``examples/embodiment/config/maniskill_ppo_openvla.yaml``
- **OpenVLA-OFT + PPO**: ``examples/embodiment/config/maniskill_ppo_openvlaoft.yaml``
- **OpenVLA + GRPO**: ``examples/embodiment/config/maniskill_grpo_openvla.yaml``
- **OpenVLA-OFT + GRPO**: ``examples/embodiment/config/maniskill_grpo_openvlaoft.yaml``

**3. Launch Commands**

To start training with a chosen configuration, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash examples/embodiment/run_embodiment.sh CHOSEN_CONFIG

For example, to train the OpenVLA model using the PPO algorithm in the ManiSkill3 environment, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash examples/embodiment/run_embodiment.sh maniskill_ppo_openvla

ManiSkill3 Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an illustrative example, we present the training results of the PPO algorithm in the ManiSkill3 environment. 
Running on a single 8-GPU H100 machine, OpenVLA (left) and OpenVLA-OFT (right) achieved over 90% success on ManiSkill3’s plate-25-main task.

We evaluated on both training and OOD(out-of-distribution) scenarios. The OOD setting includes variations on Vision, Semantic, and Execution.
The best-performing model for each task is highlighted in bold.

.. note:: 
   The same OOD test set used in `rl4vla` (`paper link <https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789>`_) is adopted here for fair comparison. 
   Base models: For the OpenVLA model, we adopt the pre-trained checkpoint available at HuggingFace 
   (`OpenVLA (Base) (aka openvla-7b-rlvla-warmup) <https://huggingface.co/gen-robot/openvla-7b-rlvla-warmup>`_). 
   For the OpenVLA-OFT model, we perform our own LoRA fine-tuning using motion planning data collected from the “PutOnPlateInScene25Main-v3” task. 
   The resulting LoRA model weights are also provided at HuggingFace (`OpenVLA-OFT (Base) <https://huggingface.co/RLinf/RLinf-OpenVLAOFT-ManiSkill-Base-Lora>`_).

.. note:: 
   The `rl4vla` model refers to PPO combined with OpenVLA under a **small batch size**, and thus should only be compared with our PPO+OpenVLA trained under similar conditions. 
   In contrast, our PPO+OpenVLA benefits from RLinf's large-scale infrastructure, allowing training with **larger batch sizes**, which we found to significantly improve performance.


The animation below shows the results of training the OpenVLA model on ManiSkill3's multi-task benchmark 
using the PPO algorithm within the RLinf framework.
