This example provides a comprehensive guide to using the **RLinf** framework in the `MetaWorld <https://metaworld.farama.org/>`_ environment
to finetune π\ :sub:`0`\ and π\ :sub:`0.5` algorithms through reinforcement learning. It covers the entire process—from environment setup and core algorithm design to training configuration, evaluation, and visualization—along with reproducible commands and configuration snippets.

The primary objective is to develop a model capable of performing robotic manipulation:

1. **Visual Understanding**: Processing RGB images from the robot's camera.
2. **Language Comprehension**: Interpreting natural-language task descriptions.
3. **Action Generation**: Producing precise robotic actions (position, rotation, gripper control).
4. **Reinforcement Learning**: Optimizing the policy via PPO with environment feedback.


Environment
-----------

**MetaWorld Environment**

- **Environment**: Multi-task simulation environment based on *MuJoCo*
- **Task**: Control a 7-DOF robotic arm to perform various manipulation tasks
- **Observation**: RGB images from off-screen cameras around the workspace
- **Action Space**: 4-dimensional continuous actions
  - 3D end-effector position control (x, y, z)
  - Gripper control (open/close)

**Data Structure**

- **Images**: RGB tensors ``[batch_size, 480, 480, 3]``
- **Task Descriptions**: Natural-language instructions
- **Actions**: Normalized continuous values
- **Rewards**: Sparse rewards based on task completion

Algorithm
---------

**Core Algorithm Components**

1. **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**

   - Advantage estimation using GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation)

   - Policy clipping with ratio limits

   - Value function clipping

   - Entropy regularization

2. **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**

   - For every state / prompt the policy generates *G* independent actions

   - Compute the advantage of each action by subtracting the group's mean reward

Dependency Installation
-----------------------

1. Clone RLinf Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

   # For mainland China users, you can use the following for better download speed:
   # git clone https://ghfast.top/github.com/RLinf/RLinf.git
   git clone https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf.git
   cd RLinf

2. Install Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Option 1: Docker Image**

Use Docker image for the experiment.

.. code:: bash

   docker run -it --rm --gpus all \
      --shm-size 20g \
      --network host \
      --name rlinf \
      -v .:/workspace/RLinf \
      rlinf/rlinf:agentic-rlinf0.1-metaworld
      # For mainland China users, you can use the following for better download speed:
      # docker.1ms.run/rlinf/rlinf:agentic-rlinf0.1-metaworld

**Option 2: Custom Environment**

Install dependencies directly in your environment by running the following command:

.. code:: bash

   # For mainland China users, you can add the `--use-mirror` flag to the install.sh command for better download speed.

   bash requirements/install.sh embodied --model openpi --env metaworld
   source .venv/bin/activate

Model Download
--------------

Before starting training, you need to download the corresponding pretrained model:

.. code:: bash

   # Download the model (choose either method)
   # Method 1: Using git clone
   git lfs install
   git clone https://huggingface.co/RLinf/RLinf-Pi0-MetaWorld-SFT
   git clone https://huggingface.co/RLinf/RLinf-Pi05-MetaWorld-SFT

   # Method 2: Using huggingface-hub
   # For mainland China users, you can use the following for better download speed:
   # export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
   pip install huggingface-hub
   hf download RLinf/RLinf-Pi0-MetaWorld-SFT --local-dir RLinf-Pi0-MetaWorld-SFT
   hf download RLinf/RLinf-Pi05-MetaWorld-SFT --local-dir RLinf-Pi05-MetaWorld-SFT

Alternatively, you can also download the model from ModelScope at https://www.modelscope.cn/models/RLinf/RLinf-Pi0-MetaWorld.

After downloading, make sure to correctly specify the model path in the configuration yaml file.

Running the Script
------------------

**1. Key Cluster Configuration**

.. code:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env: 0-3
         rollout: 4-7
         actor: 0-7

   rollout:
      pipeline_stage_num: 2

You can flexibly configure the GPU count for env, rollout, and actor components.
Additionally, by setting ``pipeline_stage_num = 2`` in the configuration,
you can achieve pipeline overlap between rollout and env, improving rollout efficiency.

.. code:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env,rollout,actor: all

You can also reconfigure the layout to achieve full sharing,
where env, rollout, and actor components all share all GPUs.

.. code:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env: 0-1
         rollout: 2-5
         actor: 6-7

You can also reconfigure the layout to achieve full separation,
where env, rollout, and actor components each use their own GPUs with no
interference, eliminating the need for offloading functionality.



**2. Configuration Files**

MetaWorld MT50 multi-task joint training configuration files (In this task setting, both training and inference are performed in a multi-task environment):

- π\ :sub:`0`\ + PPO:
  ``examples/embodiment/config/metaworld_50_ppo_openpi.yaml``

- π\ :sub:`0.5`\ + PPO:
  ``examples/embodiment/config/metaworld_50_ppo_openpi_pi05.yaml``

**3. Launch Commands**

command:

.. code:: bash
