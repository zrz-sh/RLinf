This example provides a complete guide to fine-tuning the 
π\ :sub:`0`\  and π\ :sub:`0.5`\  algorithms with reinforcement learning
using the **RLinf** framework. It covers the entire process—from
environment input, core algorithms, training script configuration to
evaluation and visualization—along with reproducible commands and
configuration snippets.

For detailed technical report, please refer to the paper: `πRL: ONLINE RL FINE-TUNING FOR FLOW-BASED VISION-LANGUAGE-ACTION MODELS <https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25889>`__.

The primary objective is to develop a model capable of performing
robotic manipulation by:

1. **Visual Understanding**: Processing RGB images from the robot’s
   camera.
2. **Language Comprehension**: Interpreting natural-language task
   descriptions.
3. **Action Generation**: Producing precise robotic actions (position,
   rotation, gripper control).
4. **Reinforcement Learning**: Optimizing the policy via the PPO with
   environment feedback.

--------------

Environment
-----------

**LIBERO Environment**

-  **Environment**: LIBERO simulation benchmark built on top of
   *robosuite* (MuJoCo).
-  **Task**: Command a 7-DoF robotic arm to perform a variety of
   household manipulation skills (pick-and-place, stacking, opening
   drawers, spatial rearrangement).
-  **Observation**: RGB images (typical resolutions 128 × 128 or 224 ×
   224) captured by off-screen cameras placed around the workspace.
-  **Action Space**: 7-dimensional continuous actions
   - 3D end-effector position control (x, y, z)
   - 3D rotation control (roll, pitch, yaw)
   - Gripper control (open / close)

**ManiSkill3 Environment**

-  **Environment**: ManiSkill3 simulation platform
-  **Task**: Control a robotic arm to grasp various objects
-  **Observation**: RGB images (224 × 224) from third-person camera
-  **Action Space**: 7-dimensional continuous actions
   - 3D position control (x, y, z)
   - 3D rotation control (roll, pitch, yaw)
   - Gripper control (open / close)

**Task Description Format**

   π\ :sub:`0`\  and π\ :sub:`0.5`\  directly use the environment-provided natural-language
   task description as the language model input.

**Data Structure**

-  **Images**: Main-view and wrist-view RGB tensors, each of shape
   ``[batch_size, 224, 224, 3]``
-  **States**: In LIBERO, states include end-effector pose (position + orientation) and gripper state. In ManiSkill3, states are robot joint angles.
-  **Task Descriptions**: Natural-language instructions
-  **Rewards**: Sparse success/failure rewards

--------------

Algorithm
---------

**Core Algorithm Components**

1. **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**

   -  Advantage estimation using GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation)
   -  Policy clipping with ratio limits
   -  Value function clipping
   -  Entropy regularization

2. **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**

   -  For every state / prompt the policy generates *G* independent
      actions
   -  Compute the advantage of each action by subtracting the group’s
      mean reward.

After downloading, please make sure to specify the model path correctly in your configuration file.

Running Scripts
---------------

**1. Key Cluster Configuration**

.. code:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env: 0-3
         rollout: 4-7
         actor: 0-7

   rollout:
      pipeline_stage_num: 2

Here you can flexibly configure the GPU count for env, rollout, and
actor components.
Additionally, by setting ``pipeline_stage_num = 2`` in the
configuration, you can achieve pipeline overlap between rollout and
env, improving rollout efficiency.

.. code:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env,rollout,actor: all

You can also reconfigure the placement to achieve complete sharing,
where env, rollout, and actor components all share all GPUs.

.. code:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env: 0-1
         rollout: 2-5
         actor: 6-7

You can also reconfigure the placement to achieve complete separation,
where env, rollout, and actor components each use their own GPUs without
interference, eliminating the need for offload functionality.

--------------

**2. Model Key Parameter Configuration**

**2.1 Model Parameters**

.. code:: yaml

   openpi:
     noise_level: 0.5 # default noise intensity for flow_sde
     noise_logvar_range: [0.08, 0.16] # default learnable noise range for flow_noise
     action_chunk: ${actor.model.num_action_chunks}
     num_steps: ${actor.model.num_steps}
     train_expert_only: True
     action_env_dim: ${actor.model.action_dim}
     noise_method: "flow_sde" # flow_sde, flow_noise
     add_value_head: False
     pi05: False 
     value_after_vlm: False

- Set different flow-matching steps via ``num_steps``.

- Use different noise injection methods by modifying ``noise_method``. We provide two options:
  `flow_sde <https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05470>`__ and
  `flow_noise <https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22094>`__.
  ``noise_level`` controls the noise intensity for ``flow_sde``, and ``noise_logvar_range`` controls the learnable noise range for ``flow_noise``.

- Enable π\ :sub:`0.5`\  model by setting ``pi05: True``.

- Control the critic position via ``value_after_vlm``: when True, the critic is connected after the VLM module output; when False, the critic input is from the action expert module output.

**2.2 Algorithm Configuration**

In the paper, we provide two technical approaches, flow-noise and flow-sde, to fine-tune π\ :sub:`0`\  and π\ :sub:`0.5`\  models. Specifically, you can choose different technical approaches by switching the following configuration:

.. code:: yaml

   algorithm:
      entropy_bonus: 0.0 # entropy regularization coefficient, set to 0.0 for flow-sde, 0.005 for flow-noise
   openpi:
     noise_method: "flow_sde" # [flow_sde,flow_noise] noise injection method, flow-sde introduces noise through ode-sde transformation, flow-noise introduces noise through noise network
     noise_level: 0.5 # noise intensity for flow-sde
     noise_logvar_range: [0.08, 0.16] # learnable noise range for flow-noise
     joint_logprob: False # whether to optimize joint probability density function. For flow-sde, please set to False. For flow-noise, please set to True.

For example, for complete parameter settings of flow-sde, please refer to ``libero_spatial_ppo_openpi.yaml``; for complete parameter settings of flow-noise, please refer to ``maniskill_ppo_openpi.yaml``.

**2.3 LoRA Settings**

.. code:: yaml

   model:
     is_lora: True
     lora_rank: 8
     gradient_checkpointing: False

If you want to use LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to fine-tune the VLM part, please set ``is_lora: True`` and configure the ``lora_rank`` parameter. Note that gradient checkpointing is currently **not supported**, please keep ``gradient_checkpointing: False``.

⭐ **2.4 Minimum Test Case** ⭐

If you encounter OOM errors or want to implement a minimum test case with as few resources as possible, you can refer to ``libero_spatial_ppo_openpi_quickstart.yaml``.
Compared to the standard task configuration, we have made the following modifications:

.. code:: yaml

   rollout_epoch: 8 -> 2
   total_num_envs: 64 -> 32
   micro_batch_size: 128 -> 64
   global_batch_size: 2048 -> 256
   lr: 5e-6 -> 1e-6
   actor.enable_offload: False -> True
   rollout.enable_offload: False -> True

On 4 H100 GPUs, we compared the results of standard parameters and minimum test parameters, and found that their performance is almost the same at the same time: (minimum test parameters optimize faster per round, but converge slower)

.. image:: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80d098f6-5286-4ff4-89be-547f43a4dc86
   :alt: Minimum test case comparison
   :width: 95%
   :align: center

If you still encounter OOM issues under the minimum parameter configuration, we provide the following solutions:

**If OOM occurs during the rollout stage:**

- Try replacing the rendering engine from ``egl`` to ``osmesa``
- Further reduce ``total_num_envs`` from 32 to 16, but increase ``rollout_epoch`` from 2 to 4 to ensure the total number of environments per rollout round remains consistent
- Check if actor's ``enable_offload`` is enabled, and set it to ``True`` if it is ``False``

**If OOM occurs during the actor stage:**

- Try reducing ``micro_batch_size`` from 64 to 32, keeping ``global_batch_size`` at 256
- Check if rollout's ``enable_offload`` is enabled, and set it to ``True`` if it is ``False``

.. note::

   If you encounter a mismatch between ``micro_batch_size`` and ``global_batch_size``, ensure that ``global_batch_size`` is an integer multiple of ``micro_batch_size`` × number of GPUs.

**2.5 Model Evaluation**

For models after SFT or RL training, we provide two evaluation methods:

- Use RLinf's unified evaluation script, refer to the `VLA Evaluation Documentation <https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/start/vla-eval.html>`__ for evaluation. This method supports parallel environment evaluation, which is fast, but only supports outputting the success rate of the entire task.

.. note::

   ``Metaworld`` and ``CALVIN`` currently do not support the evaluation mode with ``env.eval.auto_reset=True``. It is recommended to use individual script files for model evaluation.

- Use individual script files for model evaluation, refer to the example `README.md <https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf/blob/main/toolkits/eval_scripts_openpi/README.md>`__. This method's evaluation scripts are consistent with the official evaluation scripts provided by ``openpi``, supporting output of success rates for each subtask, but it is slower.

**3. Configuration Files**

Using libero-10 as an example, the configuration files for π\ :sub:`0`\  and π\ :sub:`0.5`\  are:

- π\ :sub:`0`\ + PPO:
   ``examples/embodiment/config/libero_10_ppo_openpi.yaml``
- π\ :sub:`0`\ + GRPO:
   ``examples/embodiment/config/libero_10_grpo_openpi.yaml``
- π\ :sub:`0.5`\ + PPO:
   ``examples/embodiment/config/libero_10_ppo_openpi_pi05.yaml``
- π\ :sub:`0.5`\ + GRPO:
   ``examples/embodiment/config/libero_10_grpo_openpi_pi05.yaml``

--------------

**4. Launch Command**

To start training with a chosen configuration, run the following
command:

::

   bash examples/embodiment/run_embodiment.sh CHOSEN_CONFIG

For example, to train the π\ :sub:`0`\  model using the PPO algorithm in
the LIBERO environment, run:

::

   bash examples/embodiment/run_embodiment.sh libero_10_ppo_openpi
