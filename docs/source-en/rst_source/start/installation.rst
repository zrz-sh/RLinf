Installation
============

RLinf supports multiple backend engines for both training and inference. As of now, the following configurations are available:

- **Megatron** and **SGLang/vLLM** for training LLMs on MATH tasks.
- **FSDP** and **Huggingface** for training VLAs on LIBERO and ManiSkill3.

Backend Engines
---------------

1. **Training Engines**

   - **FSDP**: A simple and efficient training engine that is beginner-friendly, widely compatible, easy to use, and supports native PyTorch modules.

   - **Megatron**: Designed for experienced developers seeking maximum performance. It supports a variety of parallel configurations and offers SOTA training speed and scalability.

2. **Inference Engines**

   - **SGLang/vLLM**: A mature and widely adopted inference engine that offers many advanced features and optimizations.

   - **Huggingface**: Easy to use, with native APIs provided by the Huggingface ecosystem.

Installation Methods
--------------------

RLinf provides two installation options. We **recommend using Docker**, as it provides the fastest and most reproducible environment.
However, if your system is incompatible with the Docker image, you can also install RLinf manually in a Python environment.


Installation Method 1: Docker Image
--------------------------------------------------

We provide Docker images for different experiments:

- **Embodied:**

  - ``rlinf/rlinf:agentic-rlinf0.1-torch2.6.0-openvla-openvlaoft-pi0`` for the Libero or ManiSkill benchmarks. For other embodied experiments, please refer to the corresponding sections in :doc:`../examples/index`

- **Math reasoning:** 

  - ``rlinf/rlinf:math-rlinf0.1-torch2.6.0-sglang0.4.6-vllm0.8.5-megatron0.13.0-te2.1`` (used for enhancing LLM reasoning on MATH tasks)


Once you've identified the appropriate image for your setup, pull the Docker image:

.. code-block:: bash

   # For mainland China users, you can use the following for better download speed:
   # docker.1ms.run/rlinf/rlinf:CHOSEN_IMAGE
   docker pull rlinf/rlinf:CHOSEN_IMAGE

Then, start the container using the pulled image:

.. warning::

  1. Ensure the docker is started with `-e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all` to enable GPU support, especially the `graphics` capability for rendering in embodied experiments.

  2. Do not override the `/root` and `/opt` directories in the container (with `-v` or `--volume` of `docker run`), as they contain important asset files and environments. If your platform requires mounting `/root`, run `link_assets` in the container after starting it to restore the asset links in the `/root` directory.

  3. Avoid changing the `$HOME` environment variable (e.g., `docker run -e HOME=/new_home`), which should be `/root` by default. ManiSkill and other tools rely on this path to find the assets. If `$HOME` is changed before running scripts in the docker image, make sure to relink the assets to the new `$HOME` by executing `link_assets`.

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run -it --gpus all \
      --shm-size 100g \
      --net=host \
      --name rlinf \
      -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all \
      rlinf/rlinf:CHOSEN_IMAGE /bin/bash

Inside the container, clone the RLinf repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   # For mainland China users, you can use the following for better download speed:
   # git clone https://ghfast.top/github.com/RLinf/RLinf.git
   git clone https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf.git
   cd RLinf

The embodied image contains multiple Python virtual environments (venv) located in the `/opt/venv` directory for different models, namely ``openvla``, ``openvla-oft``, and ``openpi``.
The default environment is set to ``openvla``.
To switch to the desired venv, use the built-in script `switch_env`:

.. code-block:: bash

   source switch_env <env_name>
   # source switch_env openvla
   # source switch_env openvla-oft
   # source switch_env openpi

.. note::

  Both the `link_assets` and `switch_env` scripts are built-in utilities in the Docker image provided by us. You can find them in `/usr/local/bin`.

Installation Method 2: UV Custom Environment
--------------------------------------------------------------
**If you have already used the Docker image, you can skip the following steps.**

You can install the dependencies for the target experiments using the `install.sh` script under the `requirements/` folder.
The script is organized by *targets* and *models*:

- ``embodied`` target (for embodied agents) with different models specified via `--model`, e.g., ``openvla``, ``openvla-oft`` or ``openpi``.

  Each embodied model also requires an ``--env`` argument to specify the environment, e.g. ``maniskill_libero``, ``behavior`` or ``metaworld``.

- ``reason`` target (for reasoning / Megatron stack).
- ``docs`` target (for building the documentation).

For example, to install the dependencies for the OpenVLA + ManiSkill LIBERO experiment, run:

.. code-block:: shell
  
  cd <path_to_RLinf_repository>
  # For mainland China users, you can add the `--use-mirror` flag to the install.sh command for better download speed.
  bash requirements/install.sh embodied --model openvla --env maniskill_libero

This will create a virtual environment under the current path named `.venv`.

To activate the virtual environment, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: shell
  
  source .venv/bin/activate

To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:

.. code-block:: shell

  deactivate

To install the reasoning (Megatron + SGLang/vLLM) stack instead, run:

.. code-block:: shell

  bash requirements/install.sh reason

You can override the default virtual environment directory using ``--venv``. For example:

.. code-block:: shell

  bash requirements/install.sh embodied --model openpi --env maniskill_libero --venv openpi-venv
  source openpi-venv/bin/activate
